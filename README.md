## Why set up Repo? 
This repo is created to house all of the coding project work associated with learning the JavaScript library React and React Native. <br> 
Projects within this repo will have been created based on tutorials encountered online for these libraries. This repo will be constantly <br>
updating with either enhancements of previous projects or entirely new projects.
